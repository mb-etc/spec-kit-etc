create a agent and prompt that allows the user to analyze the chat history and extract their prompts and the agent's responses for analysis. we would utilze this after a branch had been fully implemented or as a one-off. it should be available after the implementation is done as an AI Analysis review. 

analysis: how many times did we go back and forth? was there anything the agent could have been more proactive about? which agent was responding? did we fail tests many times over? what context was lacking?

Feedback loop: within the project, modify the agents in small, approved, ways to tailor them repeatedly after use.

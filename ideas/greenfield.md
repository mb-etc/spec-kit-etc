We should prompt the user on the install of spec kit to ask them if htis is th efirst time running and if they want a spec-kit instructions.md file placed in the root of their directory for further instructions. 

additionally if greenfield is selected one thing thats lacking right now is any sort of guidance on how to inilize the project - i know we start with the constitution but that just seems generally unclear to the user. I think there needs to be some sort of project architecture, roadmap/ideas place to put things, in addition to anythign else you can think of that would be useful.
